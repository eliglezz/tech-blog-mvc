## Description
Created to a mock up of what a backend database for a store would look like. Database used was mysql and later deployed to heroku. Database was built using starter code provided. I created parts of the models and most of the routes code.<br>
## Installation
Fork the repo, Clone the repo. Run `npm i` in the terminal to get the necessary packages. Now run `node seeds` in the terminal to seed the database, sometimes the database must be created before seeding. A `.env` file with the mysql credentials and database being used must be added aas well. After the user must `node server.js` to run the local server. The user should now be able to get, post, put, and delete through insomnia to their localhost.<br>
